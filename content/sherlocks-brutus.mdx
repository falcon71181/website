# Sherlock Scenario
HackTheBox - [Sherlocks Brutus](https://app.hackthebox.com/sherlocks/Brutus)

In this very easy Sherlock, you will familiarize yourself with Unix auth.log and wtmp logs. We'll explore a scenario where a Confluence server was brute-forced via its SSH service. After gaining access to the server, the attacker performed additional activities, which we can track using auth.log. Although auth.log is primarily used for brute-force analysis, we will delve into the full potential of this artifact in our investigation, including aspects of privilege escalation, persistence, and even some visibility into command execution.

> Unzip  Brutus.zip
<CodeBlock title="Terminal">
```bash
7z x Brutus.zip
```
</CodeBlock>

## Task 1
***Analyzing the auth.log, can you identify the IP address used by the attacker to carry out a brute force attack?***

**1. Open `auth.log` file using ur editor.**

<CodeBlock title="Terminal">
```bash
nvim auth.log
```
</CodeBlock>

**2. Upon reviewing the `auth.log` traffic, we can identify ***2 IPs***.**

*203.101.190.9*
![Sherlocks Brutus](/assets/htb/sherlocks-brutus/asset1.png)

*65.2.161.68*
![Sherlocks Brutus](/assets/htb/sherlocks-brutus/asset2.png)

**3. Notice that first IP `203.101.190.9` login single time unlike second IP `65.2.161.68`.**
**4. Another thing , Notice that `65.2.161.68` able to login after so many *failed attempts*. Indicates that suspect is trying to brute force into.**

>[!RESULT]
> 1st Task --> ANS: 65.2.161.68

***

## Task 2
***The brute force attempts were successful, and the attacker gained access to an account on the server.
What is the username of this account?***

**1. Notice that, suspect did a brute force attack and was successful for user `root`.**

![Sherlocks Brutus](/assets/htb/sherlocks-brutus/asset4.png)

>[!RESULT]
> 2nd Task --> ANS: root

***

## Task 3
***Can you identify the timestamp when the attacker manually logged in to the server to carry out their objectives?***

**1. Make use of `grep` to filter `auth.log.`**
<CodeBlock title="Terminal">
```bash
cat auth.log | grep "session opened" | grep "root"
```
</CodeBlock>

![Sherlocks Brutus](/assets/htb/sherlocks-brutus/asset5.png)

**2. Check first Accepted password by `65.2.161.68`.**
![Sherlocks Brutus](/assets/htb/sherlocks-brutus/asset6.png)

>[!NOTE]
> Note that , as its first instance , it means its the result of brute force attack. Suspect yet did'nt logged in manually.

We need to find second instance.
![Sherlocks Brutus](/assets/htb/sherlocks-brutus/asset7.png)

**3. Cross check result of cat and second instance.**

Times came out to be - `Mar  6 06:32:44`
However, the 06:32:44 is the times for the attempt for successfull login.
So the answer should be `06:32:45`

>[!RESULT]
> 3rd Task --> ANS: 2024-03-06 06:32:45

***

## Task 4
***SSH login sessions are tracked and assigned a session number upon login.
What is the session number assigned to the attacker's session for the user account from Question 2?***

**1. Check logs around `Mar 6 06:32:44`.**

We will find session number there i.e. 37.

>[!RESULT]
> 4rd Task --> ANS: 37

***

## Task 5
***The attacker added a new user as part of their persistence strategy on the server and gave this new user account higher privileges.
What is the name of this account?***

**1. Make use of `grep` to find out new user and its logs.**
<CodeBlock title="Terminal">
```bash
cat auth.log | grep "groupadd"
```
</CodeBlock>

As we can see new user `cyberjunkie` was added to group `gshadow`.
![Sherlocks Brutus](/assets/htb/sherlocks-brutus/asset9.png)

>[!RESULT]
> 5rd Task --> ANS: cyberjunkie

***

## Task 6
***What is the MITRE ATT&CK sub-technique ID used for persistence?***

**1. We can find it on official site .**

i.e. - [Mitre official site](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003)

>[!RESULT]
> 6th Task --> ANS: T1136.001

***

## Task 7
***How long did the attacker's first SSH session last based on the previously confirmed authentication time
and session ending within the auth.log? (seconds)***

**1. Make use of `last` command.**

<CodeBlock title="Terminal">
```bash
last -f wtmp
```
</CodeBlock>

We can see time interval `12:02 - 12:07`
![Sherlocks Brutus](/assets/htb/sherlocks-brutus/asset10.png)

>[!RESULT]
> 7th Task --> ANS: 279 sec

***

## Task 8
***The attacker logged into their backdoor account and utilized their higher privileges to download a script. What is the full command executed using sudo?***

**1. Make use of `cat` and `grep`**

<CodeBlock title="Terminal">
```bash
cat auth.log | grep "COMMAND"
```
</CodeBlock>

We can see that suspect has downloaded and ran the script.
